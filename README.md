## A Special Touch: Design Trivia!

What sets this game apart is the integration of design-focused trivia. Before you roll the dice, you're presented with a question about famous designers, UX principles, color theory, or design history. 

* **Answer correctly**, and you increase your chances of a higher roll, helping you climb the ladders to victory!
* **Answer incorrectly**, and you might just find yourself sliding down a snake.

This feature adds a fun, educational layer to the game, testing your knowledge as you play.
